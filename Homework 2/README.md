# WARNING!
* You can use this folder to work on homework 3, however, keep in mind that you will not be able to directly save changes to these files across binder sessions (i.e. once you leave the binder session, your changes will be erased -- even if you save them).
	* Instead, you can save your changes in the rstudio session **and then export the file to your computer using the file browser**

* You are encouraged to try to get rstudio working locally on your local computer. Alternatively, if you are struggling to get R to run on your laptop, you can try an alternative site that will save and execute your R code. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) will host and run your code for free, as will [Microsoft](https://notebooks.azure.com/).
